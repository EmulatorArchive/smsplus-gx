27/03/2007: Eke-Eke
 - corrected bug which made some SMS games not being fullscreen displayed
 - modified sound mixer for more correct FM music (try Wonderboy III Dragon's Trap)
 - FM is now disabled by default (only a few games use the FM unit and enabling FM forces the console type to japanese)
