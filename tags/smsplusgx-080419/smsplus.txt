  SMSPlus emulates Sega's Master System and Game Gear systems. It was
  originally created by Charles MacDonald and ported to the Nintendo GameCube
  by The "Genesis Plus" Team. It is an open source emulator and a community
  project which aims to bring you blast processing into the past.

  Using this "emulator" you will be able to enjoy all of your classic 8bit
  games in all of their glory. SMSPlus has been converted from a PC
  based platform to run on the GameCube's proprietary PPC Gekko processor
  and features customized code to give you the best gaming experience
  possible.

  This port is based on SMSPlus 1.3 sourcecode but it's also featuring a lot of
  modifications & additions to improve games compatibility, emulation accuracy
  and various peripheral supports. See changelog.txt for the whole history.

The emulator is provided as a .dol which is a Gamecube Executable. You only need to load and run
the DOL on your GC or WII (Gamecube Pad needed) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

.Wii versions are also provided: they have been compiled to run in Wii mode and should be loaded
using your prefered method (Twilight hack,...). PAL Wii users should always use smsplus_wii_pal60.*


SDCARD users should create a directory named "smsplus" at the root of the SDCARD.
Inside this directory, you have to create then a subdirectory named "roms" to put all your roms.
You should also create a subdirectory named "saves" where SRAM and FreezeState files will be saved.

.For Wii users,  the native SD slot can also be acceded, just use the same directory structure as above.
Actually, only FAT16 is supported (default FAT), be sure that your SDCARD is correctly formatted !


If using a DVD to load the roms, the format of the image you burned must be ISO9960
or you won't be able to read from it. The maximal readable size is 1.35GB for Gamecube users
and 4.7GB for Wii users.

.Please note that only the Gamecube version of this emulator has DVD support,
and you need a mod-chipped console to run DVD-R.


IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory. ALso note taht the more file you put in the same directory,
	   the slowest it would be to browse it.

  You'll start off with the main introduction screen and after pressing "A"
  you will be at the main menu. Note that at anytime during gameplay you can
  return to the main menu by tapping on that little Z button (you know, the
  one on your controller).

  Of course it's a menu so you have yourself a few things to choose from.
  So here's a list and what they do.


  PLAY GAME:    Takes you into or back to the game.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  HARD RESET:   Simulate hard reset off the emulated system
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  LOAD NEW GAME:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here you can choose to load a rom either from:
	  - a SD adapter (SLOT A or SLOTB),
	  - Front SD slot (Wii mode only)
	  - a DVD (GC mode only)
	  
	and a file selection menu should appear

	In this new selection menu, the following controls can be used:
		A button : load the selected file
		B button : go up one directory
		Z button : quit the file selection menu
		L/R triggers : go down/up one full page
		Left/Right buttons or Analog stick : scroll the selected entry's filename when it can't be full displayed
		Up/Down buttons or Analog stick : select previous/next file

	If you are using SDCARD, the program will look for a folder named "/genplus/roms".


  EMULATOR OPTIONS:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      FM Type let you disable FM emulation (OFF) or choose between two FM emulators (YM2413,EMU2413).
	Please not that only some Japanese games feature FM music so enabling this 
	will force the system into japanese mode.

      Country let you force the region of the game.
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.
	Some games may be region protected.

      Console Type let you force the type of console to be emulated
	(Master System 1, 2 or Japanese (MARK III), Gamegear...)
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.

      Joypad let you invert Button 1 and 2 assignments
	TypeA means that Button 1 is Button A on the GC pad.
	TypeB means that Button 1 is Button B on the GC pad.

      SMS BIOS let you enabled BIOS support (some BIOS have built-in game) if BIOS file has been found
      (BIOS file need to be renamed SMS_BIOS.sms and put in /smsplus directory)


DISPLAY OPTIONS:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aspect let you choose the Display Aspect Ratio:
	. ORIGINAL mode automatically set the correct aspect ratio exactly as if you connected a real MasterSystem on your TV.
	In this mode, the full resolution (720 x 480 or 720x574 pixels) is used to include horizontal and vertical borders
	around the active display area. This mode may not be compatible with HDTV and the component cable.
	
	. STRETCH mode let you adjust horizontal and vertical scale values so that the active display fits your TV screen.
	When using this mode, the resolution width is fixed to 640 pixels and borders are not emulated.

Render let you choose the Display Rendering mode:
	. ORIGINAL let you use the original Master System rendering modes:
	these modes generally output a progressive 240 lines (288 lines for PAL) display.
	In this mode, games should look exactly as they did on the real hardware.

	.BILINEAR vertically scales (using hardware filtering features) the original display to a 480 lines (574 lines for PAL) interlaced display.
	In this mode, because of the higher resolution, games generally look better than on the real hardware but some artifacts might appear 
	during intensive and fast action.

        .PROGRESS swith the rendering to Progressive Video Mode (480p), only use this with component cable and a compatible TV.

TV Mode let you choose the TV Mode to use:
	.50/60Hz: in this mode, the Gamecube automatically switch between the appropriates 50hz and 60Hz TV modes depending
	on the current region mode. This makes PAL & NTSC games looking exactly like they did on the real connsole

	.60Hz: in this mode, the Gamecube always use a 60Hz (NTSC or PAL60) TV mode, use this if your TV does not support 50Hz.

	.50Hz: in this mode, the Gamecube always use a 50Hz (PAL) TV mode, use this if your TV does not support 60Hz.

Overscan let you enable/disable the border colour emulation:
	when ON, the background colour is used (like on a real SMS).
	when OFF, borders are forced to black.
	When ASPECT mode is set to FIT SCREEN, this option is automatically set to OFF.
	On the other way, enabling this option automatically set ASPECT mode to ORIGINAL.

Center X/Center Y let you adjust the screen position while keeping the display aspect ratio. 

Scale X/Scale Y let you adjust the display aspect ratio. This option is only accessible when using STRETCH aspect mode.


SAVESTATE MANAGER:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  STATE is the actual state of your game. It is independant from any in-game save support 
  so that you can restart the game exactly where you previously stop playing.
  
  You can now choose the device type and location.
  Be sure to set this according to your system configuration before saving/loading files.

  . Device: Let you choose the device to use: SDCARD or MCARD
  . SLOT: Let you choose which MC slot to use for the device

   IMPORTANT:
   
   1/ when using NGC Memory Card in SLOTA, some mounting errors may occur. In this case,
      remove and insert the Memory Card again before trying to save/load anything.

   2/ when using SDCARD, the directory /smsplus/saves must exist

   3/ for Wii users, please note that the SD slot can *NOT* be acceeded so use a SD-Adapter in a MC SLot



  STOP DVD MOTOR :  Stop the DVD motor and the disc from spinning during playtime (GC mode only)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  SD/PSO or TP-Hack RELOAD:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      In Wii mode, this will reboot the TP loader.
      In GC mode, you can call this to go back to SD/PSO Loader

  SYSTEM REBOOT
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This will reboot the console.
