  SMSPlus emulates Sega's Master System and Game Gear systems. It was
  originally created by Charles MacDonald and ported to the Nintendo GameCube
  by The "Genesis Plus" Team. It is an open source emulator and a community
  project which aims to bring you blast processing into the past.

  Using this "emulator" you will be able to enjoy all of your classic 8bit
  games in all of their glory. SMSPlus has been converted from a PC
  based platform to run on the GameCube's proprietary PPC Gekko processor
  and features customized code to give you the best gaming experience
  possible.

  This port is based on SMSPlus 1.3 sourcecode but it's also featuring a lot of
  modifications & additions to improve games compatibility, emulation accuracy
  and various peripheral supports. See changelog.txt for the whole history.

The emulator is provided as a .dol which is a Gamecube Executable. You only need to load and run
the DOL on your GC or WII (Gamecube Pad needed) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

SDCARD users should create a directory named "smsplus" at the root of the SDCARD.
Inside this directory, you have to create then a subdirectory named "roms" to put all your roms.
You should also create a subdirectory named "saves" where SRAM and FreezeState files will be saved.

If using a DVD to load the roms, the format of the image you burned must be ISO9960
or you won't be able to read from it. The maximal readable size is 1.35GB for Gamecube users
and 4.7GB for Wii users.

IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory.

  You'll start off with the main introduction screen and after pressing "A"
  you will be at the main menu. Note that at anytime during gameplay you can
  return to the main menu by tapping on that little Z button (you know, the
  one on your controller).

  Of course it's a menu so you have yourself a few things to choose from.
  So here's a list and what they do.


  PLAY GAME:    Takes you into or back to the game.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  RESET GAME:   Simulate pressing reset on the emulator
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  LOAD NEW GAME:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Load from DVD:
    ****************

       A DVD browser is displayed. Navigate and select your ROM from here.
       IMPORTANT: Your DVD must be in ISO9660 format

    * Load from SDCARD:
    *******************

       A SDCARD browser is displayed. Navigate and select your ROM from here.
       IMPORTANT: To load roms from SDCARD, you have to use a SDCARD adapter in MC SlotA
		  On the SDCARD, roms must be initially placed in the /smsplus/roms/ subdirectory

   In both cases, the maximum number of files per directory (DVD or SDCARD) is 1000.
   It is *recommended* to use subdirectories.
   Pressing B will make you going up one directory.



  EMULATOR OPTIONS:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      X and Y are to try to compensate for TVs with high overscan, or if
	you just want to play on a smaller area.

      Joypad let you invert Button 1 and 2 assignments
	TypeA means that Button 1 is Button A on the GC pad.
	TypeB means that Button 1 is Button B on the GC pad.


    NOTE: The following options will reload the current game

      FM Type let you disable FM emulation (OFF) or choose between two FM emulators (YM2413,EMU2413).
	Please not that only some Japanese games feature FM music so enabling this 
	will force the system into japanese mode.

      CPU Type let you force NTSC (60hz) or PAL (50hz) timings for the game.
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.

      Region let you force the region of the game.
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.
	Some games may be region protected.

      Console Type let you force the type of console to be emulated
	(Master System 1, 2 or Japanese (MARK III), Gamegear...)
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.

      Mapper let you force the Memory Mapper used by the Game.
	NONE means that no mappers will be used
	SEGA means that the default mapper will be used
	CODIES means that the Codemaster mapper will be used
	Let this to AUTO if you want the program to pick automatically the best setting for each game.
    


  SAVESTATE MANAGER:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  STATE is the actual state of your game. It is independant from any in-game save support 
  so that you can restart the game exactly where you previously stop playing.
  
  You can now choose the device type and location.
  Be sure to set this according to your system configuration before saving/loading files.

  . Device: Let you choose the device to use: SDCARD or MCARD
  . SLOT: Let you choose which MC slot to use for the device

   IMPORTANT:
   
   1/ when using NGC Memory Card in SLOTA, some mounting errors may occur. In this case,
      remove and insert the Memory Card again before trying to save/load anything.

   2/ when using SDCARD, the directory /smsplus/saves must exist

   3/ for Wii users, please note that the SD slot can *NOT* be acceeded so use a SD-Adapter in a MC SLot



  STOP DVD MOTOR :  Stop the DVD motor and the disc from spinning during playtime
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  SYSTEM REBOOT:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      For users of SDLoad or PSOLoad, you can call this to go back.
      For others, this will reboot the system

According to the GNU status of this project, the sourcecode MUST be included in any binary releases you made.
To recompile the sourcecode, you will need to have installed:
 . DevkitPPC environment
 . libOGC last sources
 
You also need to replace the gu_psasm.S file which is located in the /LIBBOGC directory (from the root of libogc source directory)
with the one included in this release and then recompile/reinstall libogc.

If you have no idea on how to compile DOLs , please refer to this thread:
