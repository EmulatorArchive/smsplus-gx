This is a port of SMS Plus, an open-source & portable Sega Master System / Game Gear emulator originally developed by [Charles MacDonald](http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/), now running on the Gamecube and Wii through [libogc & devkitpro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/).

Please note that the original code has been slightly modifed to improve game compatibility, emulation accuracy as well as adding support for extra peripherals. SMS Plus now also supports SG-1000 and Colecovision games !

If you want to port SMS Plus to another platform, be sure to check the updated core on SVN and give me some feedback.

Read the included user manual for additional informations.

**IMPORTANT:**

**This emulator is NOT being updated anymore, you should use the last version of  [Genesis Plus GX](http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/) instead, which now emulates SG-1000, Master System & Game Gear as well.**
